### Database Schema

The project uses SQLite3 with the following tables:

- **users**: Stores user details (id, full_name, email, password, role).
- **events**: Stores event details (id, event_name, description, location, date).
- **purchases**: Tracks user applications for events.
- **inventory**: Tracks products, quantities, and pricing.
- **inventoryTransactions**: Logs inventory changes for events.

### Purpose

Fyay simplifies event management by integrating user applications, inventory control, and event logistics into a single platform. Its design aims to reduce manual effort for organizers while providing a seamless experience for users.

### Aesthetic

The project employs a professional color palette to enhance user experience:

- **Primary Colors**: #F7AD4E, #d69031, #4f3512
- **Accent Colors**: #FFCC80, #966d25
- **Text and Background**: #333333, #FFFFFF, #f5f5f5

### Testing and Limitations

#### Testing:

- The project was tested on both desktop and mobile browsers for responsiveness.
- All routes were tested with valid and invalid inputs.

#### Limitations:

- The platform assumes a single admin user for simplicity.
- Inventory restocking after event deletion relies on accurate transaction logs.

### Future Improvements

- Implement role-based access control for multiple administrators.
- Enhance reporting capabilities with detailed event analytics.
- Add email notifications for event confirmations and updates.

Fyay represents a blend of practical functionality and efficient design, offering a streamlined experience for users and administrators alike.
